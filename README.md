# Multithreaded-HTTP-Server
This project is a basic HTTP server that supports multithreading and uses a connection queue that's thread-safe with mutex locks. It's designed to handle only "GET" requests.

This gives it the ability to concurrently communicate with multiple clients, something any real web server would need to do, without the high overhead of forking several client processes.

In fact, to avoid the costs of repeatedly creating and destroying threads as clients connect to and disconnect from the server, it uses a thread pool design pattern. The main thread of the server process handles accepting new client connections with accept() and then passes responsibility for communicating with the new client to a “worker” thread in the thread pool.

The key to this design is the implementation of a queue data structure to pass work from the main thread to the thread pool and to coordinate the activities of each thread in the pool. The queue stores file descriptors for the client-specific connection sockets that are generated by calls to accept().

This queue is also thread safe, meaning that even with multiple threads concurrently accessing memory storing the queue, the queue’s state and data does not become corrupted. Furthermore, the queue has some helpful timing synchronization built in. When a thread tries to add to a full queue, it is blocked until space is made available. When a thread tries to remove from an empty queue, it is blocked until a data element is made available.

This involves setting up a TCP server socket and accepting incoming client connection requests in the main() function defined in the http_server.c file and then implementing HTTP request parsing and response generation by completing the HTTP library functions defined in http.c.

## This project uses a number of important systems programming topics:

- TCP server socket setup and initialization with socket(), bind(), and listen()
- Server-side TCP communication with accept() followed by read() and write()
- HTTP request parsing and response generation
- Clean server termination through signal handling
- Thread creation and management with pthread_create() and pthread_join()
- Implementation of a thread-safe queue data structure with the pthread_mutex_t and pthread_cond_t primitives
